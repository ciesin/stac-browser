    "purpose": "The GRID3 COD - Settlement Extents v3.1 consists of a geographic representation of settlements in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, in two forms: 1) settlement polygons, and 2) spatial points depicting the centroids of settled grid cells at 3-arc seconds (or ~100 meters) contained within settlement polygons. Data inputs and methodology are described in the data\u00a0release\u00a0notes.",
