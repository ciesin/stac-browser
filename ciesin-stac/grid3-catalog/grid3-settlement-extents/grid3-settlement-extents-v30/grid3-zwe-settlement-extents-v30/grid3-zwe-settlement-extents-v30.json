    "purpose": "The GRID3 ZWE - Settlement Extents v3.0 consists of a geographic representation of settlements in Zimbabwe, in two forms: 1) settlement polygons, and 2) spatial points depicting the centroids of settled grid cells at 3-arc seconds (or ~100 meters) contained within settlement polygons. Both layers include attributes as described in the codebooks. Data inputs and methodology are described in data release notes.",
